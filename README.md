Text-to-Image Generator Web Application Using React.js and Node.js for Dynamic Image Creation and Storage I led the development of a Generative AI Text-to-Image Generation Platform using Full-Stack Development. I built the end-to-end application using React.js, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB on the frontend and backend, while integrating text-to-image AI models (like Stable Diffusion) on the server side. Users could input prompts, trigger backend model inference, and view or save generated imagesâ€”creating a seamless AI-powered user experience.
